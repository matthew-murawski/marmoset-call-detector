% frame_params
% compute basic frame sizing parameters from ms and sampling rate.
% % this is a placeholder stub. real logic will be added in later prompts.

%
% inputs
%   fs: sample rate in hz
%   win_ms: window length in ms
%   hop_ms: hop length in ms

% output
%   F: struct with fields (to be defined in later steps)
