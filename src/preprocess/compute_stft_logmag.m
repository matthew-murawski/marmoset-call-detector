function [S, f, t] = compute_stft_logmag(audio, fs, bandpass, win_ms, hop_ms)
% compute_stft_logmag
% compute a band-limited log-magnitude spectrogram.
% % this is a placeholder stub. real logic will be added in later prompts.

%
% inputs
%   audio: column vector (double)
%   fs: sample rate in hz
%   bandpass: [low high] in hz
%   win_ms: window length in ms
%   hop_ms: hop length in ms
%
% outputs
%   S: log-magnitude spectrogram (frequency x time)
%   f: frequency axis (hz)
%   t: time axis (s)
